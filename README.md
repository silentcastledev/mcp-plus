## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) extends Claude's capabilities by allowing it to interact with your local environment, APIs, and services. This enables Claude to:

- Access and analyze your private data
- Interact with your local tools and services
- Perform actions on your behalf through custom integrations
